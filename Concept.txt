This folder is a plugin extention for Wan2GP.
I want it to place a small floating button on the bottom right of the window, 
These will toggle elements of the page.

One button will toggle
Resolution
Frames
Infrence steps
Advanced Mode
Set settings as default
Export Settings to File 
Reset Settings
Load Settings from Video
Download Lora


This will allow me to just view the prompt and generate sections.
This will be particularly helpful on mobile devices like phones.




Currently when I press the button its only toggling Advanced Mode



Nice to have:
Retain status for reloads
Smooth Animation
